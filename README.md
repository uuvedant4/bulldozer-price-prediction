# ***Bulldozer Price Prediction Using Machine Learning***

* In this notebook, I have gone through a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers `(regresssion problem)`.

* It is a Structured Data Project (Structured data is data you'd usually find in an Excel spreadsheet, pandas DataFrame or similar tabular style file.)

* The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

## Data: 

* The data is downloaded from the **Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition** : https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data


* There are 3 main datasets:

   * **Train.csv** is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
   * **Valid.csv** is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.
   * **Test.csv** is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.

## ***The libraries used are:***

* **Pandas** for data analysis.

* **NumPy** for numerical operations.

* **Matplotlib/seaborn** for plotting or data visualization.

* **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning modelling and evaluation.
